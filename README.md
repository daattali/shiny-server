# Dean Attali's Shiny Server

> *Copyright 2016 [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com). Licensed under the MIT license.*

This repo contains the setup of [my Shiny server](http://daattali.com/shiny/).  It is a git repo under `/srv/shiny-server` on my server.

To learn how you can get your own Shiny Server in a similar way, [read my tutorial about how to set up Shiny Server](http://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/).

Shiny servers can host shiny apps and R markdown documents.

The [config](./config) directory contains a few configuration files that are used on the server.
